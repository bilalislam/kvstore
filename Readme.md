# distributed key-value & config store

## motivation

As an application stands up, as you all know, it is always based on a configuration file.This file contains all the data that we expect to be variable, sensitive and confidential for that application.In this project, we will examine how we have purified our dotnet core application from all the configuration information in a distributed, concurrent way.
